\begin{defn}
	An element $r \in R$ is called a unit if there exists $s \in R$ such that $rs = 1$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
	$0$ is never a unit, unless $R$ is the trivial group, $\{0\}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{defn}
	Any non-trivial ring $R$ in which every element except $0$ is a unit is called a field.
	
	In other words, a field is a ring in which all non-zero elements have multiplicative inverses.
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
	$\CC$, $\RR$, $\QQ$, $\ZZ/p\ZZ$ ($p$ is prime) are examples of fields.
\end{exmp}
