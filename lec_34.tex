The goal today is to prove the following theorem:	If $K / F$ is a finite field extension, then there is $\alpha \in K$ such that $K = F(\alpha)$.

First, some background work on polynomials:
\begin{prop}
	Let $f(x), g(x) \in F[x], f(x) \neq 0$ and $K/F$ a field extension. 
	\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
		\item $F[x]$ is a subring of $K[x]$, so any computation in  $F[x]$ is valid in $F[x]$. 
		\item Euclidean division of $g(x)$ by $f(x)$ gives the same answer in $F[x]$ or in  $K[x]$.
		\item $f(x)$ divides $g(x)$ in $K[x]$ $\iff$  $f(x)$ divides $g(x)$ in $F[x]$.
		\item The monic greatest common denominator, $d(x)$, of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is the same, whether computed in $F[x]$ or in $K[x]$.
		\item If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have a common root in $K$, then they are not relatively prime in $F[x]$.

			Conversely, if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not relatively prime in $F[x]$, there exists an extension of  $F$ in which they have a common root.
		\item If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $F$, and $f(x), g(x)$ have a common root in $K$, then $f(x)$ divides $g(x)$ in $F[x]$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}[Derivative]
	If $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$ in $F[x]$, its \emph{derivative} is the polynomial \[
		f'(x) = na_nx^{n-1} + (n-1)a_n{n-1}x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1,
	\]
	in which you interpret the integer $k$ as $\underbrace{1_F + 1_F + \cdots + 1_F}_\text{$k$ times}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
	The usual rules of differentiation apply, e.g. product rule.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
	Let $f(x) \in F[x]$. An element $\alpha$ in an extension $K$ of $F$ is a multiple root, meaning $(x - \alpha)^2$ divides $f(x)$ $\iff$ $\alpha$ is a root of $f'(x)$. 	
\end{lem}

\begin{prop}
	Let $f(x) \in F[x]$. Then there exists a field extension $K$ of $F$ in which $f(x)$ has a multiple root if, and only if, $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ are not relatively prime.
\end{prop}

\begin{lem}
	Let $f(x)$ be a irreducible polynomial over $F$.
	\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
		\item Then, $f$ has no multiple roots in any field extension \emph{unless} $f' = 0$.
		\item In characteristic $0$, $f$ has no multiple root over any field extension.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{defn}[Primitive Element]
	Let $K / F$ be a field extension. An element $\alpha \in K$ is called \emph{primitive} if $K = F(\alpha)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Primitive Element Theorem]\label{l34:pet}
	Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $0$, and let $K / F$ be a finite field extension. Then, there exists a primitive element in $K$.
\end{thm}
